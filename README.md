### Tools used for this analysis:
- Python (3.12.0)
- Pandas (2.1.1)
- Microsoft Power BI

### The goal of this project:
1. The distribution of the different movie factors (imdb, critic ratings, year of releases, etc...)
2. What the features of each movie represent (i.e., if I click a movie title, display the right visuals)
3. IMDB & Critic rating vs Box office performance.
4. Put in hyperlink for awesome button link (On the last page of the Power BI dashboard)
4. Overall Christmas themed design.

### What I've learned:
- Data visualization using Power BI.
- Organization of different types of data.
